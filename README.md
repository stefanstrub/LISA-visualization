# LISA-visualization

LISA consists of three satellites orbiting the sun, trailing earth completing one cartwheel-like motion during the course of one year. the three satellites are pictured as orange, green and blue dots. The sizes of earth and LISA are not to scale, but the
distances between all objects and the size of the sun are at scale.

# Videos
The videos show LISA orbiting the sun while a Gravitational wave is traveling perpendicular to the plane of LISA's and earth's orbit. The amplitude of the wave is vastly exaggerated. For visualizations purposes a low frequency wave is chosen which is below LISA's sensitivity. Gravitational waves in the LISA's sensitivity spectrum would oscillate to fast for visualizing a one year LISA orbit in 20 seconds.

In the corner we show the change of distance between the three satellites of LISA with a view locked to the center of LISA and perpendicular to the plane of the three satellites. This change of distance is LISA's measurement of the Gravitational wave.

It is recommended to download the videos for proper display since viewing the vidoes in the browser are zoomed in.

# Picture
LISAâ€™s constellation is pictured at eight different points in time with 1.5 month intervals.
